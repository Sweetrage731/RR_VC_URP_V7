Quick help: how to use this asset?
----------------------------------

Mystify FX is an all-in-one fx asset for creating all kind of blur, distortion and visual effects that can applied to a single object or area.
It's not a full-screen post processing effect, so it's faster to render as it only affects specific objects.

To use MystifyFX, select the desired object and add the MystifyFX component to it.

You can also right click in the hierarchy and select GameObject -> Effects -> Mystify FX.
